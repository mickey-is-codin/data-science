<h1> Kaggle Competition Projects </h1>

<p>
Location to store any kaggle competition projects that I work on. Kaggle competitions have been a great way for me to exercise data science practices along with machine learning and deep learning on real data. The competitions are mostly for fun and I personally enjoy creating tools for navigating/gaining insights into datasets, but they're a blast to work on.
