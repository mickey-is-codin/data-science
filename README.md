# Mickey Smith Data Science Repo

This repo was originally created to be house all of the data science projects I created while learning machine learning and deep learning. Most of the projects contained within are Tensorflow tutorials, NLP tutorials, and my attempts at kaggle shadow competitions (nothing submitted but using old datasets for learning concepts).
