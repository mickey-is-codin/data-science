<h1>Mickey Smith Data Science Repo</h1>

<p>
    This is absolutely not anything that needs to be git-tracked, 
    however I'm trying to get better at git and thought this
    would be a good way to do so. I work pretty frequently on
    random little projects that fall under the umbrella of 
    data science so I thought this would be a good way to improve
    the visibility of those projects as well as to hold me to 
    some standards of care so that my projects are at least 
    good enough to be worth publishing.

<p>
    As of now, May 16, 2019, the projects I've included are:
    <ul>
        <li>LOTR</li>
            <p>
                A data science project that just attempts to mess around with the text 
                of the 3 Lord of the Rings books. 
            </p>
        <li>Russia</li>
            <p>
                An attempt to familiarize myself with NetworkX framework within Python
                as well as to try to follow a series of articles I read between
                The Atlantic and the OCCRP.
            </p>
        <li>Yelp</li>
            <p>
                A data science project inspired by a Joe Rogan podcast trying to 
                determine whether or not the number of stars given in a review
                correlates to positivity or negativity of the review.
            </p>
        <li>Basic Sentdex Tensorflow Tutorials</li>
            <p>
                Just getting the feel for using Tensorflow instead of PyTorch.
                These are contained in Tensorflow/Playground.
            </p>
        <li>Neural Network Filter Visualization</li>
            <p>
                Following a Toward Data Science tutorial for visualizing the
                weights of a neural network in order to determine if training
                is effective for the network.
            </p>
    </ul>
