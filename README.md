<h1>Mickey Smith Data Science Repo</h1>

<p>
    This is absolutely not anything that needs to be git-tracked,
    however I'm trying to get better at git and thought this
    would be a good way to do so. I work pretty frequently on
    random little projects that fall under the umbrella of
    data science so I thought this would be a good way to improve
    the visibility of those projects as well as to hold me to
    some standards of care so that my projects are at least
    good enough to be worth publishing.

<p>
    As of now, May 16, 2019, the projects I've included are:
    <ul>
        <li>LOTR</li>
            <p>
                A data science project that just attempts to mess around with the text
                of the 3 Lord of the Rings books.

                    <li>Try to implement Tensorflow</li>
                    <li>Look into NLP Toolkit</li>
                    <li>Sentiment analysis by chapter/character</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <li>Russia Networking Program</li>
            <p>
                An attempt to familiarize myself with NetworkX framework within Python
                as well as to try to follow a series of articles I read between
                The Atlantic and the OCCRP.

                    <li>Not really trying to add much more functionally</li>
                    <li>As I read more articles I'll include them in the web</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <li>Yelp Analysis</li>
            <p>
                A data science project inspired by a Joe Rogan podcast trying to
                determine whether or not the number of stars given in a review
                correlates to positivity or negativity of the review.

                </ul>
            </p>
        <li>Divvy Rideshare Analysis</li>
            <p>
                Kaggle competition analysis revolving divvy ridesharing data. The
                dataset contains information on several years of Divvy bike rides in
                Chicago over several years. Analytical goals revolve around analysis
                of rides for time of day. Trying to build mapping and locational
                density analysis depending on where rides occur at given time of day.

            </p>
        <li>Electric Motor Analysis</li>
            <p>
                Kaggle competition dataset regarding temperature of electric car
                motors. Goal of analysis is to determine effect of heading on
                temperature at given locations of the motor.

            <p>
                Just getting the feel for using Tensorflow instead of PyTorch.
                These are contained in Tensorflow/Playground.

        <li>Neural Network Filter Visualization</li>
            <p>
                Following a Toward Data Science tutorial for visualizing the
                weights of a neural network in order to determine if training
                is effective for the network.
